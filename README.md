# PokefinderTCG

## Description
Pokefinder TCG is a trading card app that is a meeting ground for those looking to part ways with their cards, and those looking for cards to snatch up. All with a nostalgic coat of paint for Pokemon fans.
After creating an account users can:
- See the cards that other users are trying to sell
- Go to the auction page where they can upload an image of a card, fill in details about it, and post it to sell.
- Contact other users through email by viewing a card's details.

To post your own card, you must go to the auction page, where you will be prompted to upload an image of the card, define a price and name for the card, as well as other optional details, submitting will have your card display on the home page.
